# SeqAfrica Hackathon at IPD Feb 2025

This repo holds instruction, notes, links, etc. for the SeqAfrica Hackathon
at IPD in February 2025.


### What will we do?

The idea of a hackathon is that a group of developers - or in our case:
bioinformaticians - get together and build something in a limited time.

We will have a day and a half (17 Feb and the afternoon of 19 Feb) to work
on this.

We have set no hard deliverables, but have picked two themes:

 1. **Democratizing Analysis**: make bioinformatics analyses more accessible
 to end users

 2. **Harmonizing AMR Detection**: building on the work done by PH4AGE, use,
 improve or extend [hAMRonization](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.07.583950v1)
 ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/pha4ge/hAMRonization))

Ideally, the two themes come together around the "SeqAfrica sentinel site
ONT laptops" that we are currently piloting.  I would summarise the goal as:

_Provide the sentinel site ONT laptop users with an easy to use system that
produces clear, comprehensive, reliable and actionable analyses of their
bacterial isolates, in particular with respect to AMR_.


### How do I prepare?

 * Docker
 * EPI2ME
